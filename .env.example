# Environment Variables for Deployment

## Vercel Environment Variables

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

### Supabase Configuration
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
```

## How to Get These Values

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Click "New Project"
   - Choose a name (e.g., "sunland-water-level")
   - Set a strong database password
   - Select a region (closest to your users)

2. **Run the Database Schema**
   - In Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
   - Run the query

3. **Get Your API Keys**
   - In Supabase dashboard, go to Settings > API
   - Copy the "Project URL" → This is your `SUPABASE_URL`
   - Copy the "anon public" key → This is your `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Copy the "service_role" key → This is your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (keep this secret!)

4. **Add to Vercel**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add all four variables
   - Make sure to check all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

## Security Notes

- **Never commit the `.env` file to git**
- The `service_role` key has admin access - keep it secret
- The `anon` key is safe to use in client-side code
- VITE_ prefixed variables are exposed to the client
